    <h1>My Sweet Heart 💗</h1>
    <p>
      As this new year begins, I want you to know
      that loving you has been the most beautiful
      chapter of my life.
      <br><br>
      You are my happiness, my peace, my smile,
      and my reason to believe in love.
      I pray this year brings you endless joy,
      laughter, success, and moments that make
      your heart glow — just like you make mine.
      <br><br>
      Thank you for being you.
      Thank you for loving me.
      I can’t wait to create more memories with you 💞
    </p>
